#     "generated_code": "To compare salaries across employees, you can merge the 'df_Employees - Salary' dataframe with the 'df_Employees - Employee Details' dataframe using the 'user_id' column. This will allow you to see the salaries along with other employee details. Here's an example of how you can do it in Python using pandas:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Merge the salary and employee details dataframes\ndf_merged = pd.merge(df_Employees_Salary, df_Employees_Details, on='user_id')\n\n# Compare salaries\nsalary_comparison = df_merged[['name', 'salary']]\nsalary_comparison = salary_comparison.sort_values(by='salary', ascending=False)\n\nprint(salary_comparison)\n```\n\nThis will give you a dataframe sorted in descending order of salaries, with the employee names and their corresponding salaries."
